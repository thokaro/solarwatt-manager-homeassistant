# SOLARWATT Manager – Home Assistant Integration

This custom integration connects a **SOLARWATT Manager** like FLEX or Rail to **Home Assistant** and provides energy- and power-related sensors.

Note for user with **vision** components: If you want to control settings like workmode, maximum charge current or discharge current try https://github.com/nathanmarlor/foxess_modbus

⚠️ **EnergyManager pro** is not supported by this integration, use https://github.com/Mas2112/solarwatt-energymanager-homeassistant instead.

---

## ✨ Features

* Local polling of Solarwatt Manager data
* Energy Dashboard ready (correct `device_class` & `state_class`)
* Automatic unit normalization (Wh → kWh)
* Entity names are normalized and installation-specific IDs are removed.
* Human‑friendly display names (Title Case; BMS/SoC/SoH preserved)
* Diagnostics data from /rest/things with devices and their "properties" exposed as diagnostic entities
* Stable `unique_id`s (safe for long‑term statistics)
* Works with Home Assistant statistics & history

---

## 📦 Installation

### Option 1: One‑click repository add via My Home Assistant (HACS)

1. Make sure **HACS** is installed in your Home Assistant instance
2. Click the button below and follow the prompts (this **adds the repository to HACS**; installation is still done in HACS):

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and add this repository.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=thokaro&repository=solarwatt-manager-homeassistant&category=integration)

3. In **HACS → Integrations**, search for **SOLARWATT Manager** and install it
4. Restart Home Assistant

---

### Option 2: Installation via HACS (manual)

1. Make sure **HACS** is installed in your Home Assistant instance
2. Go to **HACS → Integrations**
3. Open the menu (⋮) in the top right corner and select **Custom repositories**
4. Add this repository URL:

```
https://github.com/thokaro/solarwatt-manager-homeassistant
```

5. Select **Integration** as the category
6. Click **Add**
7. Search for **SOLARWATT Manager** in HACS and install it
8. Restart Home Assistant

---

### Option 3: Manual Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Copy the folder:

```
custom_components/solarwatt_manager
```

into your Home Assistant configuration directory:

```
config/custom_components/
```

3. Restart Home Assistant

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

After restarting Home Assistant:

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Search for **SOLARWATT Manager**
4. Enter the required connection details
5. Select the SOLARWATT devices you want to create

### Options

You can adjust these in the integration options:

* **Update interval (seconds)** – polling interval
* **Name prefix (optional)** – prefix for entity names
* **Energy delta (kWh)** – write energy updates only if the change is >= threshold; set to `0` to write every update
* **Device selection** – choose which detected SOLARWATT devices should be created in Home Assistant

---

## 🔋 Energy Dashboard

Energy sensors are provided in kWh and prepared for the Energy Dashboard (`device_class: energy`, `state_class: total_increasing`). Which sensors you use depends on your setup.

---

## 🚗 evcc Sensors

If you want to use sensors from this integration in **evcc**, please refer to the instructions (in german).

* [evvc-guide-german.md](docs/evvc-guide-german.md)

---

## 📋 Kiwigrid Items

Here you will find an overview of the most important Kiwigrid items.

* [kiwigrid-items.md](docs/kiwigrid-items.md)

---

## 🧠 Naming Strategy

* Internal sensor keys remain unchanged for stability
* Display names:

  * remove technical prefixes (e.g. `harmonized`)
  * replace underscores (`_`) with spaces
  * Title Case formatting with exceptions for common acronyms/brands (e.g. `BMS`, `SoC`, `SoH`, `AC`, `DC`, `PV`, `MPPT`, `SMA`, `KEBA`, `SunSpec`, `Modbus`, `FoxESS`)


This keeps entities readable without breaking existing statistics.
